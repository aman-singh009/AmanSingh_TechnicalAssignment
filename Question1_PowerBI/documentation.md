Power BI Data Modeling \& DAX Optimization

📌 Overview



This document provides a comprehensive explanation of Power BI’s data modeling architecture and DAX optimization techniques, with a focus on handling large datasets (10M+ records).

It covers schema design, calculated elements, performance best practices, relationship management, and common pitfalls to avoid in enterprise reporting.



📖 Contents



Star Schema vs. Snowflake Schema



Differences in structure, usability, performance, and best-fit scenarios.



Calculated Columns vs. Measures vs. Calculated Tables



Definitions, storage impact, performance trade-offs, and use cases.



Performance Optimization for Large Datasets



Techniques for data modeling, column optimization, aggregations, incremental refresh, query folding, and DAX improvements.



Managing Relationships \& Avoiding Circular References



Best practices for defining relationships, using bridge tables, role-playing dimensions, and preventing loops.



Common DAX Pitfalls \& Solutions



Overusing calculated columns, context confusion, FILTER misuse, high cardinality issues, ALL misuse, EARLIER reliance, and complex RLS.



🚀 Key Takeaways



Prefer Star Schema → Simpler, faster, and better compression with VertiPaq.



Use Measures over Calculated Columns → Keeps models lean and improves performance.



Optimize for Large Datasets → Remove unnecessary columns, use surrogate keys, pre-aggregate, and apply incremental refresh.



Manage Relationships Carefully → Prefer single-direction one-to-many, avoid excessive bi-directional links, and use bridge tables when needed.



Avoid DAX Pitfalls → Understand row vs. filter context, use variables, minimize FILTER on fact tables, and simplify RLS.
