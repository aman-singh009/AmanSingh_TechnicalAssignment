Reflection on Business Intelligence (BI) Strategy Roadmap



📌 Introduction



This project focused on designing a secure, scalable, and collaborative BI strategy for a pharmaceutical company with diverse stakeholders—R\&D, Manufacturing, Sales, Regulatory Affairs, Finance, IT, and Executives.



At its core, the challenge was not just technical, but organizational: aligning conflicting priorities, addressing compliance concerns, and ensuring adoption across departments. Through a six-month phased roadmap, the strategy balanced quick wins with long-term sustainability.



🧐 Reflections \& Learnings

1\. Stakeholder Dynamics



R\&D vs Sales: The tension between protecting sensitive trial data and providing transparency for forecasts showed the importance of role-based access and anonymization.



Manufacturing vs IT: Real-time dashboards were essential, but stability concerns required replicated data layers rather than direct ERP queries.



Sales vs Finance: Disputes on revenue definitions highlighted the value of standardized KPIs as a single source of truth.



Regulatory Affairs: Their insistence on audit trails taught me that compliance cannot be an afterthought—lineage and audit logging must be embedded from the start.



Reflection: BI success depends more on trust and alignment than on technology. This reinforced the idea that people, not tools, decide adoption.



2\. Architecture Choices



We adopted a federated data architecture with AWS services:



Ingestion: Kafka/Kinesis + connectors.



Storage: S3 (Raw → Staging → Curated → Presentation).



Processing: AWS Glue, Spark, Athena/Redshift.



BI Layer: Power BI / QuickSight with row-level security.



Governance: Data catalog, lineage tools, role-based access.



Reflection: A federated approach struck the right balance—departments kept ownership, while enterprise-wide visibility was still achieved. This taught me that architecture design must respect departmental autonomy without losing sight of the bigger picture.



3\. Change Management



We applied Prosci’s ADKAR model:



Awareness (communicating BI’s purpose),



Desire (quick-win dashboards),



Knowledge (training),



Ability (hands-on adoption),



Reinforcement (executive usage + data champions).



Reflection: Change management was just as critical as technical delivery. Without adoption campaigns, even the best dashboards risk becoming unused.



4\. ROI \& Value Creation



Sales forecasting accuracy improved by 3–5%.



Manufacturing downtime reduced by 10–15%.



Regulatory audit prep time cut by 50%.



Expected ROI in 9–12 months on a ~$150K budget.



Reflection: Framing BI in financial terms made it easier to gain executive buy-in. I learned that every data strategy must link back to measurable business impact.



5\. Risks \& Mitigation



R\&D resistance → solved with anonymization \& RBAC.



ERP performance risks → solved with curated reporting layers.



Compliance failures → solved with lineage \& audit logs.



Slow adoption → solved with training, champions, and executive sponsorship.



Reflection: Anticipating risks upfront gave credibility to the roadmap. I learned that risk registers aren’t just documents—they are trust-building tools.



🚀 Key Takeaways



BI is not about dashboards—it’s about decisions. Adoption and trust matter more than visualizations.



Architecture must serve both autonomy and integration. Federated models help balance local control with enterprise goals.



Governance is a business enabler. Compliance, lineage, and audit trails build trust and reduce resistance.



Quick wins fuel adoption. Early prototypes and reconciled dashboards secure sponsorship.



ROI storytelling matters. Executives need to see BI as a financial and strategic investment.
